Create and sell digital gift cards that customers can redeem at your store.

== Description ==

Gift Cards allows you to create and sell digital gift cards that customers can use to pay for orders at your store. Every time you receive an order for a gift card, a unique gift card code of equal value is generated and sent to the specified recipient. The gift card owner can:

* use it to pay for orders by entering the code directly at checkout; or
* add the gift card to their account for later use.
