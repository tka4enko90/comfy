These settings can be changed at the Settings => Writing screen.

There are two options:

* When network-activated this plugin will set the classic editor as default and prevent site administrators and users from changing editors.
The settings can be changed and default network-wide editor can be selected on the Network Settings screen.
* When not network-activated each site administrator will be able to activate the plugin and choose options for their users.
